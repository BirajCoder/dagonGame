# dagonGame - An Amazing Project

I used JavaScript to create this game. A canvas was made where all the necessary editings and graphical parts are shown. I used a set of Images in the game like the clouds and bushes, the dragon was made dynamic by moving a set of Images at a contant rate making the game look a lot realistic, I also implemented to get a high score and the score is saved in the browsers memory so the highest score of all time in a particular browser will also be shown in the game. There is a bot feature that is a bit tricky and can help you to cheat within the game by crossing all hurdles automatically , you don't have to do a thing.

## Features

1. Play in mobile or Computer. For computer the dragon can jump by the response of the spacebar click and also by clicking on the jump button. For Smartphones there is a click button which allows the Dragon to Jump. 
2. The Bot button is used to make the dragon run automatically, you can just click the bot button and the dragon will jump on it's own whenever it gets a hurdle , Preety Interesting!! correct? To stop the bot action click on the bot button again and the drag forgets to detect the hurdle infront of itself. 
3. Did you know you can get the highest score of all times? The browsers memory is used to save the high score in a particular browser, Go on brag about your high score to others and challenge them in the game.

Enjoy the game and do star this repository if you like it. Thank You !
